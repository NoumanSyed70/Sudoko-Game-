#Sudoku Game - C++
This repository contains the source code for a console-based Sudoku game implemented in C++. The game allows users to solve Sudoku puzzles interactively, with features like puzzle generation, input validation, and hints. This project was developed as part of my coursework in the second semester and serves as a practical example of problem-solving using C++.

#Features:
Interactive Gameplay: Play the classic Sudoku game through a simple text-based interface.
Puzzle Generation: Generate random Sudoku puzzles with varying difficulty levels.
Input Validation: Automatically checks whether the userâ€™s input follows Sudoku rules.
Hints: Provides hints to assist players in solving puzzles.
Backtracking Algorithm: Uses a backtracking approach to solve and validate Sudoku grids.
#Technologies Used:
1. C++
2. Standard Template Library (STL)
This project allowed me to enhance my understanding of algorithms, particularly backtracking and helped me strengthen my skills in C++.
